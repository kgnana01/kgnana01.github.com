		<p> Hi! My name is Keerthana, or KG as many of my friends at Tufts like to call me <br/>
		    and I am a senior at Tufts University majoring in Biochemistry. I am a first <br/>
		    generation American, and I was born and raised in the Greater Boston Area. I <br/>
		    lived in Harvard Square until I was about seven, and then moved to Medford. <br/>
		    Growing up I spent much of my time practicing piano and dancing, and I have always <br/>
		    had a love for baking. After completing high school, I enrolled in Tufts University <br/>
	            and have become very active in the world of science and drug discovery. I aspire <br/>
		    to work in the biotech/pharmaceutical industry after I graduate. </p>
