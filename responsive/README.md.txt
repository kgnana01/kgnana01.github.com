Lab 4
I think I was able to correctly implement the task of creating 
two different versions of the same website that reads either dice or 
no dice, but I am not 100% sure if the smaller screen option works because
I do not have a smart device to test it on. I spent about 45 minutes on it
and did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
