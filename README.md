Assignment 1

I believe I was successfully able to create the 3 desired files and placed them
in the correct repo of my GitHub account. I actually learned a lot from this assignment,
and really enjoyed playing with different options with CSS. I spent quite a long time on 
this assignment, probably about 9-10 hours because this is all completely new to me. I did
not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. Things that could have gone better- I
did not take advantage of GitHub and did not constantly commit my work because I am still
getting used to this system and did not fully understand how to use it properly. Also do not 
own a smart phone/tablet so not completely sure how my second CSS sheet looks.
